This lab centers on building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, with a focus on secure, JWT-based authentication to protect endpoints. Postman is used for thorough testing and validation of the API functionalities. Additionally, it introduces the concept of microservices by dividing tasks into two independent services: auth-service.js handles user registration, login, and token management, while product-service.js manages product data and operations. With the inclusion of server.js as the entry point, these microservices are unified under a single server, enhancing modularity and scalability. The lab aims to deepen your understanding of API development, secure authentication practices, and the flexibility of microservices architecture.
